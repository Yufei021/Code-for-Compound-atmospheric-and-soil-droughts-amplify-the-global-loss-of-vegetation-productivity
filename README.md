# Code-for-Compound-atmospheric-and-soil-droughts-amplify-the-global-loss-of-vegetation-productivity
This code quantifies the impacts of high VPD alone, low SM alone, and compound droughts (CDs) on vegetation productivity, using GPP as a proxy. lt accounts for post-drought lag effects. The analysis includes :
1) calculating characteristics of three types of droughts (the code in the folder named “drought_cha”),
2) identifying drought periods and drought lagged periods (the code "NH&SH_drought_lag.R" in the folder named “GPP_loss_cal”),
3) calculating GPP loss from droughts impact (the code "leave_one_out.R" and "NH&SH_GPP_loss_lag.R" in the folder named “GPP_loss_cal”),
4) analyzing influencing factors of GPP loss (the code in the folder named “impact_factor"),
5) and calculating recovery time after droughts (the code in the folder named “recovery_time")
